The project aims to develop a logistic regression model to predict hill and valley patterns using geographical data. The objectives include analyzing relevant topographical features, such as elevation and slope, to improve the accuracy of predictions. Additionally, the project will evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and demonstrate its potential applications in geographical planning and environmental studies.
